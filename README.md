# Hi there :wave:

My name is Elliot, I'm a Senior Software Engineer / Engineering Manager depending on where I'm needed. I'm currently working at 🌞[Sunbeam](https://sunbeam.cx)🕶️ as a Senior Software Engineer. Previously I was an Engineering Manager at 🎵[DICE](https://dice.fm)🔈, and before that at 🍔[Just Eat Takeaway.com](https://www.justeattakeaway.com/)🥘 .

I mostly work with Python and Elixir these days, although in the past I've also worked a lot with C# / .NET, NodeJS / JavaScript, and a bunch of cloud and distributed computing tech. I live in the United Kingdom and I work remote.

I post on [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@elliotblackburn), [blog](https://www.elliotblackburn.com), and from time to time [speak](https://speakerdeck.com/bluehatbrit) about things.
